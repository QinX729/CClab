                <h3 class="green">Scientific Name:</h3>
                <p>✨🐟Piscis Spectratus🐟✨</p>

                <h3 class="green">Discovered by / at:</h3>
                <p>In unknown coastal waters on July 29th, 2000, by Dr. Sinc. </p>

                <h3 class="green">Family:</h3>
                <p>✨🐟Spectrish🐟✨ usually move around in a group of three. They got their name from their ability to shift colors through a beautiful 
                    spectrum between two set hues. Most of the time, ✨🐟Spectrish🐟✨ within the same group share the same color spectrum, though each 
                    individual varies slightly in movement and the pace of color transition. Their synchronized glow in the ocean often makes them appear
                    like living rainbows beneath the waves.</p>
            <h3 class="green">Appearance:</h3>
                <p>At first sight, ✨🐟Spectrish🐟✨ appear quite simple. Their heads are nearly perfect spheres, with elegant, silk-like tails gently 
                    waving behind their bodies. Under the light, these tails shimmer as if woven from liquid light. Their simple form and psychedelic 
                    colors make them true little geniuses of the sea.

                <h3 class="green">Habitat:</h3>
                <p>✨🐟Spectrish🐟✨ are remarkably friendly creatures. They are naturally curious about humans and will willingly approach anyone who enters 
                    their detectable range. Various observations have shown that ✨🐟Spectrish🐟✨'s color-changing behavior is linked to the weather. Multiple 
                    researchers, fishermen, and tourists have reported that ✨🐟Spectrish🐟✨ tend to shift colors more rapidly during storms. In 
                    contrast, on sunny and warm days when the tides are calm, their colors flow softly, reflecting the peace of the sea.

                <h3 class="green">What we know so far about ✨🐟spectrish🐟✨?</h3>
                According to Dr. Sinc, ✨🐟Spectrish🐟✨ were first discovered after a fierce storm at sea.

    <span>
        “It was a hot summer,” Dr. Sinc recalled. “I was wandering along the shore when I noticed some psychedelically colorful lights flickering beneath the water.”
That was the first recorded encounter with ✨🐟Spectrish🐟✨.

“When I named it, I couldn't help but write down ✨🐟Spectrish🐟✨,” Dr. Sinc laughed, eyes gleaming with ✨🐟Spectrish🐟✨-like light. “No ordinary name could 
ever match my miraculous little fish!”

        ✨🐟Spectrish🐟✨ are very close to human beings, which makes them easy to approach—and, unfortunately, easy to catch. The most important rule, however, is that 
✨🐟SPECTRISH🐟✨ ALWAYS LIVE IN GROUPS OF THREE. They are inseparable. If one becomes separated, it will instantly attempt to return to its group, even if it 
means crossing great distances or temporarily leaving the water, or even if it's held by someone or some net. 
                <span class="red">Nothing will stop them! NOTHING!</span>

        Since 2005, the capture of ✨🐟Spectrish🐟✨ by amateurs has been strictly prohibited. Several reports have described sudden extreme weather events following 
the capture of these creatures. Many believe that ✨🐟Spectrish🐟✨ are somehow connected to the balance of local marine climates.
Despite the ban, illegal ✨🐟Spectrish🐟✨ fishing continues due to the immense profits involved. Scientists have spent decades trying to breed ✨🐟Spectrish🐟✨ 
in captivity, but so far, success remains elusive. 
                <span class="red"> ✨🐟Spectrish🐟✨ fishing should be banned forever!
                </span>
                Due to massive profits, ✨🐟Spectrish🐟✨ fishing industry still exists. Scientists have tried decades to breed ✨🐟spectrish🐟✨ manually, but little 
                progress have been made.

                <span class="white">To interact with ✨🐟Spectrish🐟✨, simply move gently near them. Once they detect your presence, they'll glide toward you 
                    in curiosity. Move your hand slowly, and you'll see ✨🐟Spectrish🐟✨ follow your gestures like enchanted light.
                <span class="red"> [Warning] Exercise caution when approaching or attempting to catch ✨🐟Spectrish🐟✨. Amateurs are not permitted to handle 
                    them without professional guidance. Improper contact has been said to trigger unpredictable storms.
